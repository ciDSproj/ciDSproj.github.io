The visualizations for the dashboard and the Sales, Product and Customer reports show important trends and figures, useful for answering some questions:

- *How was the sales trend over the months?*
- *What are the most frequently purchased products?*
- *How was the sales amount by country?*
- *What are the most profitable segment customers?*

Using the dashboard and the reports, we can monitor results and progress. By immediately having the right information available, correct decisions can be made.
