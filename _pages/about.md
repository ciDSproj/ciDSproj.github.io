I'm an Entry Level Data Scientist passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights, supporting the decision-making process. I specialize in exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and interactive dashboards using Python programming, statistical analysis, and machine learning for my data projects and Power BI for visual storytelling.

I’ve recently completed several hands-on projects that include: 
- Analyzing complex datasets to uncover trends and patterns
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for classification and regression tasks
- Create compelling visualizations using Power BI and Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Design interactive dashboards that communicate insights clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences

I’m continuously learning and refining my skills, and I’m excited to contribute to data-driven decision-making process in a collaborative environment.
