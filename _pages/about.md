Entry Level Data Scientist passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights. 

# About Me

I focus on exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and interactive dashboards. I use Python programming, statistical analysis, and machine learning for my data projects, and Power BI for visual storytelling.

I’ve recently completed several hands-on projects that include: 
- Analyzing complex datasets to uncover trends and patterns
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for classification and regression tasks
- Create compelling visualizations using Power BI and Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Design interactive dashboards that communicate insights clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences

My previous experience as software test/support engineer allowed me to acquire strong analytical, problem-solving and communication skills.
Looking for a career switch to Data Science, I’m eager to join a data-driven team where I can contribute to impactful projects, continue learning and grow into a well-rounded data professional. I bring curiosity,  attention to detail, and the ability to make complex information accessible and visually compelling.

Outside of data science, I enjoy hiking, skiing, traveling, and playing with my dog Layla.
