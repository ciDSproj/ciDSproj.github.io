Featured Projects
======
1. **Credit Risk Analysis**<br/>
Improved classification model accuracy by 18%, increasing performance from 65% to 77%, and analyzed the trade-off between accuracy and F1 score for predicting the minority class.
2. **Health Insurance Prediction**<br/>
Developed a predictive model that improved insurance forecast accuracy by 33%, significantly outperforming previous forecasting methods and enabling more accurate insurance planning.
3. **CO2 Forecasting with Time Series**<br/>
