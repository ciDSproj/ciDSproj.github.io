Featured Projects
======
1. **Credit Risk Analysis**
Improved classification model accuracy by 18%, increasing performance from 65% to 77%, and analyzed the trade-off between accuracy and F1 score for predicting the minority class.
2. **Health Insurance Prediction**
Developed a predictive model that improved insurance forecast accuracy by 33%, significantly outperforming previous forecasting methods and enabling more accurate insurance planning.
3. **Online Sales Product Analysis**
Used SQLite and Python to retrieve data from a database, explore and analyze seasonal sales trends by region and payment distribution.
4. **Web Scraping and Text Analysis**
Scraped job postings, streamlined and analyzed text (Python, NLTK), engineered features to quantify the average salary, the tools and platforms valued by companies.
5. **Ecommerce Performance Dashboard**
Designed an interactive Power BI report to track KPIs across products and regions identifying most profitable segment customers.
6. **CO2 Forecasting with Time Series**
Used a seasonal ARIMA model to produce one-step ahead, dynamic, and future forecasts for CO2 atmospheric concentrations. Visualized trends and seasonality using Python.
