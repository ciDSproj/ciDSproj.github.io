This analysis focuses on CO2 atmospheric concentrations dataset. It covers data preparation and exploration using visualization and STL decomposition, checking stationarity by applying the Dickey-Fuller test and computing and plotting the ACF and PACF values.

Using grid search were identified the best parameters for building a seasonal ARIMA model. The model  was used for producing one-step ahead, dynamic, and future forecasts.
