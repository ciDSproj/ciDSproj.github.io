**What factors influence students’ test scores?**

 

Exploratory Data Analysis highlighted some factors that impact students’ ability to excel academically: **test preparation** courses, **weekly study hours**, **parent education**, **practicing sports** regularly, **gender** and **ethnic groups**.


The plot below shows the influence of parental education. We observe that the highest number of parents have some college education, and the lowest number have a master's degree. Students with parents that have a master’s degree education level have the highest scores.
