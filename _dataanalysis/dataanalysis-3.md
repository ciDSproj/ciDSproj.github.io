**What factors influence students’ test scores?**

 

Exploratory Data Analysis highlighted some factors that impact students’ ability to excel academically: **test preparation** courses, **weekly study hours**, **parent education**, **practicing sports** regularly, **gender** and **ethnic groups**.


The plot below shows the influence of parental education. We observe that the highest number of parents have some college education, and the lowest number have a master's degree. Students with parents that have a master’s degree education level have the highest scores.

Here we can see the influence of test preparation and weekly study hours. Students who prepare for tests perform better than those who do not. More study time (more than 10 hours per week) leads to higher overall grades.
